/**
 * VSCode Settings Strategy
 *
 * The VSCode Settings Strategy is responsible for finding a suitable
 * Biome binary from the user's settings in the VSCode workspace configuration.
 *
 * This strategy supports platform-specific settings, meaning that the user can
 * specify different binaries for different combos of OS, architecture and libc.
 *
 * If the `biome.lsp.bin` setting is specified as a string, the strategy will
 * attempt to locate the binary at the specified path. If the binary is not found
 * at the specified path, the strategy will return `undefined`.
 *
 * If the `biome.lsp.bin` setting is specified as an object, the strategy will
 * attempt to locate the binary at the specified path for the current platform
 * (OS, architecture and libc). If the binary is not found at the specified path,
 * the strategy will return `undefined`. The keys of the object are the OS, architecture
 * and libc combos, concatenated with a dash (`-`), and the values are the paths to
 * the binaries.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "biome.lsp.bin": {
 *   	"linux-x64": "/path/to/biome",
 *      "linux-arm64-musl": "/path/to/biome",
 *      "darwin-arm64": "/path/to/biome",
 *      "win32-x64": "/path/to/biome.exe"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * General VS Code settings overriding rules apply.

/**
 * Node Modules Locator Strategy
 *
 * The Node Modules Locator Strategy is responsible for finding a suitable
 * Biome binary from the project's dependencies in the `node_modules` directory
 * by looking for a `@biomejs/cli-{platform}-{arch}{libc}` package, which would
 * usually have been installed as a transitive dependency by the user's package
 * manager.
 *
 * The locator is implemented in such a way that it should work with most if
 * not all packages managers, including npm, pnpm, yarn and bun. Using node's
 * built-in `createRequire`, we create a require function that is scoped to the
 * root `@biomejs/biome` package, which allows us to resolve the platform-specific
 * `@biomejs/cli-{platform}-{arch}{libc}` package. We then resolve the path to the
 * `biome` binary by looking for the `biome` executable in the root of the package.
 *
 * On Linux, we always use the `musl` variant of the binary because it has the
 * advantage of having been built statically. This is meant to improve the
 * compatibility with various systems such as NixOS, which handle dynamically
 * linked binaries differently.
