/**
 * This file exists as a stopgap to ensure that Biome does not attempt
 * resolve the configuration files in parent directories for the test
 * fixtures that do not have their own configuration files.
 *
 * This is necessary because some configuration options may have an
 * impact on the behavior of the test fixtures, notably, in the root
 * of this repo we ignore files in the `test/fixtures` directory to
 * ensure we don't format them accidentally. Unfortunately, this
 * means that when opening test fixtures that do not have their own
 * configuration file as workspace folders, the configuration options
 * in the root of the repo will be applied to them, prevent us from
 * running the tests reliably.
 *
 * Test fixtures that do have their own configuration files will be
 * resolved as expected.
 *
 * Keep this configuration empty.
