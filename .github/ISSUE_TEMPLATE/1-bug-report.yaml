        A minimal reproduction of the issue. This should be a link to a git repository.

        Please be aware that **issues without a minimal reproduction are likely to be closed** without 
        further investigation. We NEED to be able to reproduce the issue in order to undestand it
        and fix it.

        Please use the `npm create @biomejs/biome-reproduction` command whenever you can to bootstrap a reproduction
        repository.

      description: |
        If applicable, include the biome trace logs. To find these logs, open the output panel and select the Biome Trace category. Try to only include the logs that are relevant to the issue.

        Alternatively, if you have the CLI installed, you can run `biome rage --daemon-logs` to retrieve the logs emitted by the daemon. Usually, these logs contain more information, but they are way more verbose.
